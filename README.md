## Projects Overview  

### 1. Transformer-Based Translation  
Translate text between Arabic and Italian using a fine-tuned MarianMT model.  
- **Model**: MarianMT (Helsinki-NLP).  
- **Features**: Custom translation pipeline and deployment with Streamlit.  

### 2. Text Classification with GPT-2  
Fine-tune GPT-2 for multi-class text classification on custom datasets.  
- **Model**: GPT-2.  
- **Features**: Classifies text into 14 unique labels.  

### 3. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Chatbot  
A chatbot that combines retrieval-based search with generative capabilities.  
- **Model**: DistilBERT + Llama (Groq).  
- **Features**: Provides precise answers with explanations for teachers and students.  

### 4. Edutech AI Assistant  
An AI-powered assistant for personalized learning in machine learning.  
- **Model**: Llama-3.2-11b.  
- **Features**: Creates personalized roadmaps, identifies strengths/weaknesses, and offers feedback.  

### 5. LangChain Integration  
Experimenting with LangChain for custom LLM applications.  
- **Features**: Swapping OpenAI models with Gemini for embeddings and completions.
